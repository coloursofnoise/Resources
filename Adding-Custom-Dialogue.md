To add custom lines of Dialogue, it is important to follow the correct [Mod Structure](https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Mod-Structure#mod-structure).

## Setting up the Dialogue File

Create a Folder named `Dialog` in your Mod's root folder. Example: `Celeste/Mods/MyExampleMap/Dialog`

In this folder you can now create a new `.txt` file. What you name this file depends on to what language you want to add your custom Dialogue. Files for Languages that are already present in Vanilla Celeste:
* `Brazilian Portuguese.txt`
* `English.txt`
* `French.txt`
* `German.txt`
* `Italian.txt`
* `Japanese.txt`
* `Korean.txt`
* `Russian.txt`
* `Simplified Chinese.txt`
* `Spanish.txt`

If a Dialogue ID from the currently selected Language is called and the specific ID, and or complete file for that language is not given, Everest defaults the displayed Dialogue to use the text in `English.txt`instead. 

Implementation for custom Languages is the same, however be sure to check what the specific Dialogue file needs to be named.

Vanilla Dialogue Files are located at `Celeste/Content/Dialog`

## Creating Dialogue Strings and IDs

In the Dialogue file you set up Strings and IDs for Dialogue. The game uses these IDs to look up what should be displayed in, for Example, a Message Box.

Example of a String and corresponding Dialogue ID out of the Vanilla `English.txt`:
```
CH2_THEO_B=
[THEO left normal]
Sorry about that.
Don't worry, I won't post that one.
```
`CH2_THEO_B` in this case is the ID, it should be named uniquely, as to not conflict with Vanilla Dialogue or Custom Dialogue from other mods. 

Example: `MAPAUTHOR_MAPNAME_JUMPDIALOG_1` instead of `Jump1` 

`[THEO left normal]` is used to determine what Dialogue Portrait and Dialogue Box should be used. 

`THEO` in this case means that the Text will display Theo's Dialogue Box and Dialogue Portrait. This can naturally be changed to use to different Character's assets.

`left` is the orientation of the Dialogue Portrait, in this case it would appear on the left side of the Dialogue Box.

`normal` is what expression the Dialogue Portrait should use. What expressions are available for a specific character, can be seen ingame by using the `portraits` command in the Debug Mode Console.

These Attributes can be completely left out, which is useful when an Entity does only display text, and not a Dialogue Box, for Example.

The rest of the Dialogue is the actual lines of text that will appear ingame when the ID is called. Here, text commands can also be used. To see a list of some available commands for modifying the displaying of text ingame and what exactly they do, check the top of the Vanilla `English.txt`. Other Commands are used throughout the game but aren't documented, like `*` which makes the displayed text shake. Be sure that you don't use the `trigger` command though, as it heavily hardcoded. If you are in dire need of more advanced Cutscenes, check [Cruor's Lua Cutscenes Mod.](https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/10788)

If you want to translate your text into another Language, create the same ID in the corresponding Language's Dialogue File. What text will be displayed, depends on the currently selected Language.

## Using generated IDs

Certain Dialogue IDs are generated and used by the game based on folder structure and filenames. These are done for Chapter Names, Checkpoint Names, Crystal Heart Poems etc. To get these IDs to display the desired text, simply copy the ID the game gives you into your Dialogue File and set it to the desired Text.
Example for a Chaptername: 
```
Map .bin file location: Celeste/Mods/MyExampleMap/ExampleLevelset/ExampleMapFolder/ExampleMap.bin
Autogenerated ID: ExampleLevelset_ExampleMapFolder_ExampleMap
Filled out String with Text: ExampleLevelset_ExampleMapFolder_ExampleMap= My Desired Name
```

## Displaying Custom Dialogue ingame
For the Autogenerated IDs this not needed as the game already calls them to be displayed.

However in maps different Entities and Triggers can also use custom Dialogue IDs to display text.
Examples include:
* Minitextbox Trigger
* Everest Dialog Cutscene
* Everest Custom NPC

To set an Object to use a set Dialog ID right click them in Ahorn to open up the Entity Properties Menu
Here you will likely see `Dialog ID` or something of similar nature. Copy your ID into the field, click update, save your map and your changes should now be present ingame.

Code Mods can also setup Custom Objects that allow for Custom Dialogue IDs to be used.

**Note:** if you happen to have Japanese, Chinese or Korean dialogue in particular, and notice that some characters are missing when you view your dialogue in-game, it might mean these characters are not in the game's font. There are ways to add them to the game, feel free to ask max480#4596 about that on [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/6qjaePQ).
