## Creating a custom tileset

### Step 1

* Go to your Celeste folder -> Content -> Graphics
* Copy the `ForegroundTiles.xml` file
* Go back to your Celeste folder, and go to Mods -> YourModFolder -> Graphics
* Create a new folder there (for example `Xaphan`)
* Paste the `ForegroundTiles.xml` file in that new folder

### Step 2

Make a copy of a tileset template, then edit it with any image editor to make your tileset.

#### Using the improved template by 0x0ade

To set up this template, open the `ForegroundTiles.xml` file you just copied. Just below `<Data>` at the beginning of the file, copy-paste the entirety of [this XML file](https://gist.github.com/0x0ade/3beb5eb3008f3f25be0b3204d1ee585a).

This XML refers to the `subfolder/betterTemplate` tileset. For it not to crash, copy the template into `Mods/yourmod/Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/tilesets/subfolder/betterTemplate.png`.

#### Using the vanilla template

You can find this template in [the graphics dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ITwCI2uJ7YflAG0OwBR4uOUEJBjwTCet/view), in `Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/tilesets/template.png`.

Here is an annotated version of this template:

### Step 3

At the end of the `ForegroundTiles.xml` file, just before the `</Data>` line, add the following line:
```xml
<Tileset id="w" copy="y" path="name" sound="8"/>
```
* Replace `w` by the id you want, that is not one already used (so do not use 1, 3 to 9, a to o, y and z). **This id has to be 1 character long.**
* Replace `y` with `z` if using the vanilla template.
* Replace `name` by the name you want to call your tileset. Remember that name, you will need it later.
* Replace `8` by whatever sound you want (see bottom of page for the list).

Then, save and close the file.

### Step 4
* Go back to your Graphics folder (the one in your mod folder) -> Atlases -> Gameplay
* Create a `tilesets` folder
* Copy your tileset there, and name it the same thing you put in ForegroundTiles.xml (`name` in this exemple)

### Step 5
* Open Ahorn and load your map
* Go to Map -> Metadata
* In the Foreground Tiles field, copy the path to your `ForegroundTiles.xml`: in this tutorial, it is `Graphics/Xaphan/ForegroundTiles.xml` (replace `Xaphan` by the name of the folder you created in step 2)
* Click Update. Save and reload your map.
