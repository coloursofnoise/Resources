## How-To: Audio mods without replacing original sounds

You'll need:
- FMOD Studio **1.10.\*** (**Don't** use FMOD Studio 2.\*, as it is incompatible with Celeste and will break projects made in 1.\*.). You will find it on the [FMOD downloads page](https://www.fmod.com/download) (you need to create an account, but the program is free).
- the Celeste FMOD project: you will also find it on the [FMOD downloads page](https://www.fmod.com/download), in the Learning Resources section. **Make sure to read the EULA.**

_FMOD Studio is compatible with WINE._

Here is a step-by-step guide to create a bank with music you have as sound files:

1. Open the Celeste FMOD project in FMOD Studio: `fmodstudio20000celeste-project/FMOD Studio Celeste Project/celeste_audio.fspro`.
2. On the left panel, switch to the Banks tab, and create a new bank for your mod. You need 1 bank per mod: if you have multiple tracks, you can fit them all in one bank. Name it, for example, `yournickname_mapname`.

3. Select File > Import Audio Files... then browse to your sound/song. This brings up a new "Audio Bin" window. You'll want to right click on your song, then select "Create New Event":

Choose "2D Event", then close the Audio Bin window.

4. On the left panel, switch to the Events tab: you'll find your sound/song there. Preferably drag it into a directory with your nickname and rename it so that the name doesn't contain symbols / spaces / etc.

5. Assign your song/sound to your bank:

6. Re-route your new event to the right bus:

    - Open the mixer window.

    - Right-click your event and reroute the event to the mains group. Don't create a new group.

    - You can now close the mixer window.

7. Add the fade parameter to your music:

    - Add the shared fade parameter by clicking the (+) tab.

    - Add automation to the master volume in the fade parameter tab.

    - Add two points at the 2 edges of the graph: -âˆž dB to 0.00 dB

    - You now have a "fade" cursor on top of the screen, adjusting now will control the music volume. This is what music fade triggers use to adjust the music volume as well.

8. Make your music loop:

    - Right click the black logic track above your audio track, and select "Add Loop Region".

    - Extend the loop region to however you see fit.

9. Hit File > Build. When this is done, you will find your bank in `fmodstudio20000celeste-project/FMOD Studio Celeste Project/Build/Desktop`. Take **only** the .bank file you created (**don't** take Master Bank.bank, sfx.bank, etc... those are the vanilla banks) and copy it to `Mods/yourmod/Audio`.

9. **Generate the GUIDs.txt**:

Once generated, you'll find it in `fmodstudio20000celeste-project/FMOD Studio Celeste Project/Build/GUIDs.txt`. Copy it in `Mods/yourmod/Audio` and rename it to `yourbankname.guids.txt`:

10. In Ahorn, you can use your music by typing its event name manually. For example, if you have this in the Events tab:

You can use this in Ahorn:

If you have any further questions regarding audio mods, ask for help in the #modding_help channel on the Discord server.

**Don't modify and share modified music, sfx, ui and master banks.**
