If you want to replace some textures in the game to make a "texture pack", all you have to do is:
- Get the graphics dump from [[Useful Links]]: that will tell you which textures exist in the game, what are their dimensions, how they are called, etc.
- Place the replacement texture(s) in `Mods/yourmodname/Graphics/[...]`, with the **exact same path** as the one in the graphics dump.

For example, to replace the Forsaken City level logo, you would place the replacement texture in `Mods/yourmodname/Graphics/Atlases/Gui/areas/city.png`.

If you want an example of a "texture pack" of sorts, take a look at [Simpleste](https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/8162). It basically replaces every single texture in the game. ~~With squares and rectangles, but still.~~

**Please note that this will affect vanilla levels as well.** This is _not_ what you want if you need custom graphics specifically for your map.

_(By the way, if you want to replace Madeline with some other character, you will need 817 sprites. No wonder there are not many texture packs out there doing that.)_
