# [Please follow the installation instructions on the Everest website.](https://everestapi.github.io/#installing-everest)

There have been installation instructions on this page in the past, but they were outdated and nobody cared about copying the new instructions from the website to the wiki. It has been replaced with this message to prevent any further issues and avoid people from following outdated instructions. Furthermore, the website automatically generates links to the latest builds, skipping navigating through the hellscape that is Azure Pipelines.

**The most up to date installation instructions can always be found on the [Everest website.](https://everestapi.github.io/#installing-everest)**
