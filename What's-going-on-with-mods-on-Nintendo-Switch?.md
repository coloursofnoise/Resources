Nintendo Switch modding is provided by https://github.com/leo60228/Fuji. Currently, Fuji requires a somewhat involved manual process to install maps. Hopefully that will change in the future, though! For now, you can install packs of Switch-compatible maps from GameBanana. For the first pack:

1. Install Atmosphere. [SDFilesSwitch](https://github.com/tumGER/SDFilesSwitch) is the recommended distribution. Version 7.3 or newer is required.
    1. Instructions are available at https://guide.sdsetup.com/
1. It is recommended that you make a backup of your save file using [Checkpoint](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases).
1. Make sure that there are no existing /atmosphere/titles/01002B30028F6000 folders on your SD card.
1. Extract the [Fuji pack](https://gamebanana.com/maps/download/201716) to the root of your SD card. It should merge with the existing atmosphere folder.
1. (This step is necessary each time you would like to play.) Launch Celeste, using the Newest LayeredFS option in Hekate.
1. The screen should be purple for about a second, and then the software will close. Reopen it.
1. The game should start. To confirm that the map pack was installed, go to any chapter and confirm that the name has changed.
1. The chapter's name contains which sides have which maps.
1. Once you start the level, it will tell you the full name and the map's creator.
1. Do not start custom levels from checkpoints. The game may crash.
